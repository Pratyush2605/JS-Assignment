Which makes your code reusable for later. Eg you can call functions from your file in other programs. Your else clause at the end of the code is useless. You could have written

    elif num % 5==0:
        return 'Buzz'
    return num
Alternatives
One problem with your code is that you have multiple exit points. Now this is not something to sweat too hard over, and it is not a goal to always try have a single exit. However it can be easier to debug a code with fewer exit points. This is of course much more relevant in longer and more complex code. Though it is a good thing to always have in mind. One way to do this is to define a new variable string

def fizz_buzz(num):
    string = ''
    if num%3==0 and num%5==0:
        string = 'FizzBuzz'

    elif num % 3 == 0:
        string = 'Fizz'

    elif num % 5==0:
        string = 'Buzz'

    if string:
       return string
    return num
The code now only has two exit points however it can still be improved. One key point is that if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, it is divisible by 15. So we can gradually build the string, like shown below

def fizz_buzz(num):
    string = ''

    if num % 3 == 0:
        string += 'Fizz'

    if num % 5==0:
        string += 'Buzz'

    if string:
       return string
    return num
As a last point the return statement could be written using a terniary conditional operator

return string if string else n
Which combines the two exit points into a single one. To sumarize

def fizz_buzz(num):
    string = ''
    if num % 3==0: string +='Fizz' 
    if num % 5==0: string +='Buzz'
    return string if string else num

if __name__ == "__main__":

    for n in range(1, 100):
        print(fizz_buzz(n))ple of both 3 and 5" = "Multiple of 15".
